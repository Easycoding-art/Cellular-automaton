Installing:
pip install git+https://github.com/Easycoding-art/Cellular-automaton.git
WARNING!
It is strongly recommended to read the state from a copy of the field passed to the function when writing rules. This will allow the cellular automaton to work correctly.

The project is designed for easy creation of a cellular automaton. All you need to do is to set a field with NumPy array, write a function that modifies the field and pass them to the constructor. The result of the automaton can be viewed in a special window or saved as a video.
For convenience, the colors of cells are set by encodings :
0 - white
1 - black
2 - blue
3 - green
4 - red
5 - orange
6 - yellow
7 - blue green
8 - marroon
9 - lime
10 - pink
11 - purple
12 - gray
13 - magenta
14 - brown
15 - forest green 
16 - navy blue
17 - rust
18 - dandilion yellow
19 - highlighter
20 - sky blue
21 - light gray
22 - dark gray
23 - tan
24 - coffee brown
25 - moon glow

You can also use cellular automata to make video effects. You need to pass the number of frames, frame length in seconds and FPS.
